/**
 * Tiny-Encryption
 * 
 * <p>A simple encryption technique, called a Caesar cipher, shifts each letter by a fixed amount.
 * For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' becomes 'B', 'B' becomes 'C', etc. Implement this cipher,
 * being careful to preserve case (uppercase stays uppercase, lowercase stays lowercase) and wrap around
 * the alphabet.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Learning Focus:</b> Using loops to process strings character by character and manipulating character values.</p>
